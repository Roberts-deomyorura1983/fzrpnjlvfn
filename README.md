I just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Ad Vitam, and I'm feeling as if my brain got tossed in a blender set to ‘confuse.’ Seriously, I went in thinking it was another sci-fi flick, but came out questioning my existence. Like usual weekdays existential crisis, but on steroids. First off, the idea of people living indefinitely—sounds like a never-ending treadmill nightmare. I barely get through Monday, I can't imagine dragging it out forever and ever. Who even thinks that's a good idea? 

The whole immortality lab looks like a disorganized Ikea, and I swear I felt a bit of envy for the dead guy in the tube by the end. Sorry for him and all, but at least he knew how to check out. There were moments when the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 feels like it’s saying: “Hey, let's tinker with the deepest human dilemmas while casually sipping on a latte. Do we even want what they're selling? I dunno, the price tag seems hefty for a few extra years of chaos.

Right, the visuals were stunning, like somebody painted with a palette of future-tech daydreams and nightmares and just went for it. But the character's names—Boris, Marlene, whatever—felt like someone raided my grandma's list of forgotten relatives. Love how I got emotionally w𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬ed with Caleb's weird journey, wandering through streets like some existential puppy lost in a skyscraper forest. At some point, I was smirking at the tech, thinking, sure, let’s pretend we're wise enough to handle this stuff without turning everything into a smoking catastrophe.

> And oh, the scene where they dig into the mysteries of life felt like a group project where everyone's forgotten their lines but are too committed to improvise. Made my head spin faster than a merry-go-round on overdrive. Went in with wide eyes, came out with a narrowing perspective on why we’d bother with more life if we can't really live it.

int main() {
    std::cout << Immortality is overrated << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

So, should you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Helpless shrug. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you want your brain to dance around like an electrified ferret. The whole idea is mind-bending, in a why did I eat that questionable sushi kind of way. Some moments hit, others... scatter into the weird, but isn't that the fun part? So, try it if you're feeling brave, or if, you know, you have an insatiable appetite for futuristic mayhem.
